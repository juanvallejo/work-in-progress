/**
 * The Java SQL framework allows for multiple database drivers. Each driver
 * should supply a class that implements the Driver interface
 * 
 * <p>
 * The DriverManager will try to load as many drivers as it can find and then
 * for any given connection request, it will ask each driver in turn to try to
 * connect to the target URL.
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is strongly recommended that each Driver class should be small and
 * standalone so that the Driver class can be loaded and queried without
 * bringing in vast quantities of supporting code.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When a Driver class is loaded, it should create an instance of itself and
 * register it with the DriverManager. This means that a user can load and
 * register a driver by doing Class.forName("foo.bah.Driver")
